                  <h1>Dual Space Vector Embedding for Depression Detection</h1>
                  <p class="lead">
                      Vector representations of words and paragraphs have been demonstrated to be robust models for sentiment detection. In this project I apply existing vector representations to detect depression related posts on Reddit. In addition, I introduce a duel vector space model to generate features in this classification problem.
                    </p>
                    <div class="item"><img alt="" src="img/portfolio/dep_7000.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
                                           
                  <p>   Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that severely impairs significant portions of the global population. According to surveys conducted by the World Health Organization, the estimated lifetime prevalence of depression worldwide is between 4-10%. The percentage of individuals who rated their depression as severely disabling is 66%, a higher percentage than all physical disorders surveyed including cancer and arthritis. Furthermore, due to the stigma associated with depression, lack of knowledge of resources and financial barriers, patients rarely seek timely, if any clinical consultation. </p>
                    
                <p>A popular venue that has emerged in recent years for sharing depression symptoms is social media. Various platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal and Reddit give the anyone with access to the internet the opportunity to share experiences relating to depression and also the opportunity to support one another. The plethora of data now publicly available on Social Media platforms present a promising opportunity to find accessible and cost effective methods of diagnosing depression. </p>
                 
                  <blockquote>
                    <p>In this project, I use word and paragraph embedding vectors to generate feature vectors to identify linguistic patterns in Reddit posts relating to depression. I will also introduce a new model of dual space word embedding to classify depression related posts. The main objective is to build a model that can differentiate posts discussing the struggle with depression from posts discussing other topics. Identifying the differences in linguistic patterns between posts describing depression and regular posts could help both individuals and online community leaders to better recognize and address depression on social media.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <h2>Data</h2>
                  <p>Although there are few formally collected Reddit corpora, the extensive Reddit API allows direct access to posts by subreddit. For this experiment, I collected 25000 posts on Reddit through the past few months. These posts include 12000 depression-related posts, 12000 general posts, and 1000 unlabeled posts. The depression posts are collected from two main subreddits: r/Depression and r/SuicideWatch. Since the depression-related posts are overwhelmingly from a first person point of view, the general posts were also collected from a variety of different subreddits that could involve first person narration. I collected posts from a diverse set of subreddits for the general collection to minimize the impact of subject-specific words.</p>
                    
                 <h2>Vector Representation</h2>
                  <p>In general, words can be represented in a continuous vector space in vector space models. Semantically similar words are mapped to points near each other. Predictive models as a category use neighboring words as word embedding to further predict words. The Skip-gram model is a predictive model which predicts source context words from target words. </p>
                
                <h2>Dual Space Model</h2>
                  <p>I propose a dual vector space model to generate feature vectors. Figure 1 describes the dual space model used for a binary classification task. First, text from class A is used to build the class A vector space using the skip-gram model and likewise for the text from class B. For feature vector generation, a given input example is evaluated in both models to generate 2 different average post embeddings for each post. The two sets of embeddings are concatenated before being scaled to create the input feature vector for the classifier. The target with the example is used as the training label for the classifier. 

                I specifically tested this model for the binary case for depression classification but the model can be generalized to multi-space representations for multi-class problems.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                  <p>With the dual space features and a logistic regression classifier, an accuracy of 70.1% can be achieved for classifying posts from the depression subreddit</p>
